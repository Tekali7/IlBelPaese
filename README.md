# Features

The website consists of three pages with numerous features which offer the user a pleasant website experience.

## Hero

The hero image showcases a pizza so that the user instantly knows what the theme of the website is about. The image is responsive and therefore changes its size on different screen sizes.

## Navigation

The navigation bar offers a quick and easy way to reach the three pages of the website, it can be found on the upper part of every page. It also shows which page the user is currently on through the buttons of the navigation bar. The selected page button will distinguish itself from the other two buttons through colors and a box around it.

## Homepage

The "Home" page informs the user about the restaurant to keep them on the website and to make the future customer take more interest in what the restaurant offers. This is achieved by describing the restaurants history, the menu and also the habit of only using fresh ingredients. These descriptions are decorated with images to further grow the interest of the customer.

## Menu

The "Menu" page presents a clean overview of what the restaurant offers. The page consists of four tables with various meals and drinks, imitating a handheld menu from the restaurant. The tables have a white underlay with a low opacity to provide more contrast and therefore give the user better readability of the tables contents.

## Contact

The "Contact" page informs the user of the opening hours of the restaurant. The hours are presented with a table, showing the opening hours for each day of the week in a horizontal line. This table also has a white underlay with low opacity to provide more contrast for the user.

## Form

The form is a feature in the "Contact" page. It gives the website user an opportunity to give the restaurant feedback, ask a question or to request something. The form consists of three input areas for the name of the user, the E-Mail Address and their message. The E-Mail Address allows the restaurant to thank the user for their feedback or to answer their questions. The message input area is slightly larger than the other input areas as this allows the user to see more of their text while writing.

## Footer

The footer consists of a heading, informing the user of the existing social medias of the restaurant. Under the heading are three icons with the according links. Two of these icons take the user to the restaurants real facebook or instagram page. The icon with the phone gives the user the opportunity to call the restaurant without the user having to manually type the restaurants real phone number.

## Future implementations

Future implementations for this website are.

- A new page to give the user the opportunity to order online.

- A downloadable menu in PDF format in the "Menu" page.

- A feature to let users make an online reservation.

- Add content to inform users about the possibility to buy gift cards.

# Typography and color scheme

The typography was chosen because it gives the user a calm and pleasant reading experience with rounded and clean letters.  
The fonts Merriweather and News Cycle from [Google fonts](<https://fonts.google.com/>) have been applied to this website.

The color scheme was chosen to represent italys flag colors, except for the red in it. The green from the navigation bar and the footer reminds the user of the countrys beautiful landscape and the earthy tan color in the selected-page button and the [fontawesome](<https://fontawesome.com/>) icons compliment this further. The white marble background reminds the user of italys history and gives the website a noble touch.

2. Locate repository (left-side or top-right icon and then on "Your repositories").
3. Select repository and navigate to "Settings" on the horizontal bar.
4. Open the "Pages" menu and select "main" for the branch.
5. The page will refresh with a link to the deployed website.
6. It may not go live for a few minutes, refresh the page to update the link.
7. Once deployed, the live website will automatically update when any changes are pushed to the main branch.

2. Locate repository and select the repository.
3. Click the green "<> Code" button.
4. If you want to clone using HTTPS, select the copy button in the HTTPS menu.
